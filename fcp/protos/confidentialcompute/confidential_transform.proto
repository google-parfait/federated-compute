  //    first_request_metadata is set, and concluding with a
  //    WriteConfigurationRequest where commit is true. This step may be
  //    repeated for multiple configuration blobs.
  // 2. The client sends an InitializeRequest which contains a
  //    container-specific proto configuration, max_num_sessions, decryption
  //    keys, and container-specific constraints. The proto configuration may
  //    refer to larger configuration blobs passed via
  //    WriteConfigurationRequests.

  // scope of data.
  //
  // The general pattern for a session is always this following where the
  // [Op] can be Configure, Write, Commit, or Finalize.
  //   --> [Op]Request       - client sends a request
  //   <-- ReadResponse      - server may write back an arbitrary number of
  //   ...                     read responses
  //   <-- ReadResponse
  //   <-- [Op]Response      - server completes the [Op] response
  //
  // The expected order of [Op]s is the following:
  // 1. Configure            - single ConfigureRequest in the first request
  // 2. -- Write*            - zero or more WriteRequests
  // 3. -- Commit (optional) - multiple write requests may be followed with a
  //                           single commit to indicate an end of a batch.
  // 4. Finalize             - FinalizeRequest indicates the end of a session,
  //                           however the finalizing operation may be
  //                           retried if necessary for the session logic.
  //
