// `FederatedTrainingApi` provides the protocol between a device and
// cloud servers for federated computations.
//
// This API works as follows:
//
// 1. Clients are associated with *populations*. A population is
//    uniquely identified by an opaque string which indicates the
//    application together with additional information like a specific
//    flavor within this application.
//
// 2. Periodically, clients issue an `EligibilityEvalCheckinRequest` to indicate
//    they are interested in participating in a computation, followed by a
//    `CheckinRequest` to actually be assigned one of the available
//    computations they are compatible with. These requests specify the
//    population for which the requests are issued.
//
// 3. The server decides whether the client shall participate in a computation,
//    and if so returns the data (a computation description and a checkpoint)
//    needed for the client to start executing the computation.
//
// 4. If the client is selected, it performs local execution. When done, the
//    client issues a `ReportRequest`, specifying both population and phase id,
//    and the updated checkpoint.
