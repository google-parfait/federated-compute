# Cross-Device Federated Computation Demo

This directory will eventually contain an example
[Federated Program platform](https://github.com/tensorflow/federated/blob/main/tensorflow_federated/python/program/README.md#platform-specific-components)
implementation that's compatible with the Federated Compute client.

See
[Towards Federated Learning at Scale: System Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01046)
(TFLaS) for additional information on scaling Federated Learning.
