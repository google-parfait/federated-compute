# Cross-Device Federated Computation Demo

This directory contains an example
[Federated Program platform](https://github.com/tensorflow/federated/blob/main/tensorflow_federated/python/program/README.md#platform-specific-components)
implementation that's compatible with the Federated Compute client. See
`federated_program_test.py` for an example of how to set up and run a Federated
Program using this package.

See
[Towards Federated Learning at Scale: System Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01046)
(TFLaS) for additional information on scaling Federated Learning.
