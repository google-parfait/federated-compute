# Simple TfLite models to use in tests.

This directory contains a couple of simple TfLite models for testing purpose.

1.  "join_model.flatbuffer": This model takes two input string tensor and
    returns the concatenated string in an output string tensor.
2.  "length_model.flatbuffer": This model takes one input string tensor and
    returns the length of the string in an int32 tensor.

These models are generated by using the TfLite converter to convert a TF
function.
