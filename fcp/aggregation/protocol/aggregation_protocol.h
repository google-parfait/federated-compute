namespace fcp::aggregation {

// Describes a abstract aggregation protocol interface between a networking
// layer (e.g. a service that handles receiving and sending messages with the
// client devices) and an implementation of an aggregation algorithm.
//
// The design of the AggregationProtocol follows a Bridge Pattern
// (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_pattern) in that it is meant to
// decouple an abstraction of the layers above and below the AggregationProtocol
// from the implementation.
//
// In this interface the receiving and sending contributing inputs or
// messages is abstracted from the actual mechanism for sending and receiving
// data over the network and from the actual aggregation mechanism.
//
// Client identification: the real client identities are hidden from the
// protocol implementations. Instead each client is identified by a client_id
// number in a range [0, num_clients) where num_clients is the number of clients
// the protocol started with or the extended number of clients, which is the
// sum of the starting num_clients and num_clients passed to each subsequent
// AddClients call.
//
// Thread safety: for any given client identified by a unique client_id, the
// protocol methods are expected to be called sequentially. But there are no
// assumptions about concurrent calls made for different clients. Specific
// implementations of AggregationProtocol are expected to handle concurrent
// calls. The caller side of the protocol isn't expected to queue messages.
