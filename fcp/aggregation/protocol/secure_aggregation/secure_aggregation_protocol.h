/**
 * Implementation of the secure aggregation protocol for the Federated Learning
 * server.
 *
 * In this version of the protocol client input is transmitted in encrypted
 * form via the Secure Aggregation protocol: The Secure Aggregation protocol
 * provides cryptographic guarantees that aggregates must be accumulated across
 * at minimum threshold of users before the server can successfully decrypt
 * them. The protocol also provides guarantees against the ability of attackers
 * to subvert privacy; for example, the protocol can ensure that users' inputs
 * remain private even against an adversary who can observe all communications
 * and internal state of the server and who can cause up to 1/3 of the clients
 * to deviate arbitrarily from the protocol.
 *
 * The SecAgg protocol proceeds in rounds, where a threshold number of clients
 * are required to complete each round before the protocol can proceed to the
 * next one and eventually produce an output in final round. It is therefore
 * important to have a round advancement policy that ensures that sufficient
 * clients make it to the final round in a reasonable time. This can be guided
 * by a per-round timeout or some other mechanism. The main purpose of
 * SecureAggregationProtocol is precisely to orchestate such round advancement,
 * and there for it does not include the cryptographic protocol implementation,
 * instead it
 * (a) re-routes al message to the underlying SecAggServer instance, and
 * (b) determines when to instruct SecAggServer to advance to the next round by
 *     following a round advancement policy.
