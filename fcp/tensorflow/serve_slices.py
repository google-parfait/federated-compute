  """Calls into a preregistered `callback_token` to serve slices of a value.

  In addition to the arguments to this function, `serve_slices` requires that
  a TensorFlow graph containing a selection function (`select_fn`) be provided
  to the server running `serve_slices`. `serve_slices` is responsible for
  providing the server with the names of the placeholder tensor inputs to the
  selection function (`select_fn_X_input_tensor_names`,
  `select_fn_key_input_tensor_name`, and `select_fn_filename_input_tensor_name`)
  and the target tensor to evalate to ensure that the slice is written to the
  provided filename (`select_fn_target_tensor_name`).

  Args:
    callback_token: An string ID corresponding to a callback registered with the
      `register_serve_slices_callback` function. This function will be invoked
      when `serve_slices` is called.
    server_val: A list of arbitrary-typed tensors from which slices may be
      generated using `select_fn`. These tensors must be passed into the
      `select_fn` by writing them to the placeholder tensors named by
      `select_fn_server_val_input_names`, which must contain exactly one tensor
      name for each tensor in `server_val`.
    max_key: An integer indicating the maxiumum slice index which may be
      requested. Slice indices start at zero and may go up to `max_key`
      (inclusive).
    select_fn_initialize_op: An op to run before each call to `select_fn` in
      order to reinitialize any state `select_fn` may contain.
    select_fn_server_val_input_tensor_names: A list of names of the tensors that
      make up the `server_val` portion of the inputs to `select_fn`. Must be the
      same length as the number of tensors in `server_val`.
    select_fn_key_input_tensor_name: The name of the tensor that is the `key`
      input to `select_fn`.
    select_fn_filename_input_tensor_name: The name of the placeholder tensor
      that is the `filename` input to `select_fn`. The `filename` is used to
      specify where the resulting slice should be written.
    select_fn_target_tensor_name: The name of the `target` tensor to run which
      will result in `select_fn`'s output being written to `filename`.

  Returns:
    A string identifier given by the underlying callback which can be used by
    clients to access the generated slices.
