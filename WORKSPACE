# This file uses repository rules to fetch external dependencies.
#
# We require that all uses of repository rules are effectively deterministic -
# they may fail, but otherwise must always produce exactly the same output for
# given parameters. For the http_archive rule, this means that you must specify
# a sha256 parameter; consequently, make sure to use stable URLs, rather than
# e.g. one that names a git branch.
#
# This is so that all(*) inputs to the build are fully determined (i.e. a
# change to build inputs requires a change to our sources), which avoids
# confusing outcomes from caching. If it is ever productive to clear your Bazel
# cache, that's a bug.
#
# (*) A Bazel build depends on local compiler toolchains (and Bazel itself), so
# it can be useful to pick a particular container image too (like some version
# of http://l.gcr.io/bazel).
#
# The repository namespace
# ------------------------
#
# Bazel's handling of @repository_names// is very broken. There is a single,
# global namespace for repositories. Conflicts are silently ignored. This is
# problematic for common dependencies. As much as possible, we use TensorFlow's
# dependencies. Things become especially difficult if we try to use our own
# version of grpc or protobuf. Current overrides:
#
#  - @com_github_gflags_gflags: tf uses 2.2.1 and we need 2.2.2 apparently.
#  - @com_google_googletest: Need to patch in support for absl flags
